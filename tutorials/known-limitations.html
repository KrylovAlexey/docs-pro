        <p>Although we are working hard on this library, it still has some known shortcomings.
            Consider this list to make sure there are no potential blockings.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Formula support is based on a third-party library</strong>
                <p>
                    We use <a href="https://github.com/sutoiku/formula.js/" target="_blank">formula.js</a> to
                    implement functions. That library is no longer under active development,
                    but we believe it's reliable enough to be utilized even in its current state.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>It is not mobile-friendly (yet)</strong>
                <p>
                    Only the basic functionality works with mobile devices, which means you should be able to
                    display, edit and scroll the grid. We can't guarantee that all the plugins will work as we
                    don't test Handsontable against mobile browsers.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>It is not available via npm/NuGet</strong>
                <p>
                    There is no officially supported package in <a href="https://www.npmjs.com" target="_blank">npm</a>
                    or <a href="http://www.nuget.org" target="_blank">NuGet</a> directories.
                    To facilitate the installation we usually use <a href="http://bower.io" target="_blank">Bower</a>.

                <strong>It uses several dependencies</strong>
                <p>
                    Our team follows the "proudly found elsewhere" principle which encourages us to make
                    use of the great work done by other developers. You will probably find the following
                    open source libraries being utilized by Handsontable:

                <strong>It is not fully covered by unit tests</strong>
                <p>
                    In the current version only a part of the code is covered by unit tests.
                    We aim to increase that number to at least 90%.

                <strong>Copy-paste is dependent on Flash</strong>
                <p>
                    We use <a href="http://zeroclipboard.org" target="_blank">ZeroClipboard</a> to allow users
                    copy and paste using the context menu.
                    That library uses Flash to make it possible. We are seriously considering switching
                    to <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/clipboard-apis/" target="_blank">Clipboard API</a>
                    as soon as it's fully supported by all popular browsers.
